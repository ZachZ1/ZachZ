# Begining Experiments 
## Theses are some Git comands that I found 
'echo "# ZachZ" >> README.md' This causes a shell of the orginal code to exist 
'git clone -https://www.google.com/- ' This will allow for the cloning of certain flies
'git add README.md' This adds files into the file to be read 
'git commit -m "first commit"' this command simply creates a new commit 
'git branch -M ZachZ1' This command allows for all of the branches to be shown 
'git push -u origin main' This pushes the command to the original branch
